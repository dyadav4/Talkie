I decided to create a UIKit based iOS app with MVVM architecture with hopes that it'll help me in learning MVVM, and how to use it to maintain a clean and simple architecture.
Using MVVM in an iOS project certainly improves things by decoupling modules, and I love using it in my projects. 

## Introduction
It's a good practice to keep a simple and organized architecture. There are various practices, techniques, patterns that are used by developers for their project, and it's perfectly fine to have your own unique architecture. 

The end goal of the usage of any design, architectural patterns is usually the same -
* Adding a new requirement should be easy.
* Completing any new task/requirement should not break any existing features.
* It should enable individual development & deployement of features.
* Components/Modules should be testable without dependencies.


## Languages / Frameworks Used
* Swift 5
* UIKit
The project is built supporting iOS 13.6, you can change the deployment target to run it on previous iOS versions.
